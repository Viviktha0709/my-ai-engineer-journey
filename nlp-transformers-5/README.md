\# NLP \& Transformers



This section covers Natural Language Processing and transformer-based models.



Topics include:

\- Text preprocessing and tokenization

\- Word embeddings

\- Attention mechanisms

\- Transformer architectures

\- Fine-tuning pretrained language models



The goal is to build a strong understanding of modern NLP systems used in production.



Status: 🚧 Planned (Week 5)
