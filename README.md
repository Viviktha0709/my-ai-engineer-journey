\# AI Engineer Journey



This repository documents my structured journey to becoming an AI Engineer.



The goal is not to collect certificates, but to:

\- deeply understand ML \& AI systems

\- build models from scratch

\- design end-to-end AI pipelines

\- document learnings and mistakes transparently



\## Structure

Each folder represents a learning phase.



\## Daily Logs

Every day includes a learning log capturing:

\- what I studied

\- what I built

\- what confused me

## Some commit messages
