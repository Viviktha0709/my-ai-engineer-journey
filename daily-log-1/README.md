## Daily Learning Logs

This directory contains a daily record of my AI Engineer learning journey.

Each file represents one day and captures:
- What I studied
- What I built or implemented
- What concepts were confusing
- Key insights or fixes
- Planned next steps

The purpose of these logs is to:
- enforce daily consistency
- encourage reflection over rote learning
- make progress and reasoning transparent

Logs format: DD-MM-YYYY.md
