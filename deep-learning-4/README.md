# Deep Learning

This section focuses on deep learning fundamentals and modern neural architectures.

Topics include:

- Neural networks and backpropagation

- Activation functions and optimization

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

- Training deep models using PyTorch

Emphasis is placed on understanding *why* architectures work,

not just how to train them.

Status: 🚧 Planned (Weeks 3–4)
