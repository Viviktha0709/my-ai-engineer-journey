# Large Language Models & RAG

This section focuses on building systems around Large Language Models (LLMs).

Topics include:

- Prompt engineering and in-context learning

- Embeddings and semantic search

- Vector databases

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

- Handling hallucinations and failure cases

The emphasis is on system design, not just API usage.

Status: 🚧 Planned (Weeks 6–7)
