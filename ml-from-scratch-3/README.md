\# Machine Learning From Scratch



This section documents implementations of core machine learning algorithms from scratch

using NumPy, without relying on high-level ML libraries.



Goals:

\- Understand the mathematics behind ML algorithms

\- Build intuition for training dynamics and failure modes

\- Learn how design choices affect performance



Algorithms implemented here will include:

\- Linear \& Logistic Regression

\- Decision Trees

\- Basic optimization techniques



Status: 🚧 Planned / In progress (Weeks 1–2)
